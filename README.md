# SignON Orchestrator Shared Schemas
The SignON Orchestrator Shared Schemas is part of [SignON](https://signon-project.eu/) an EU H2020 research and innovation funded project.  
This repository contains the field shared between [SignON Orchestrator OpenAPI](https://github.com/signon-project/wp2-orchestrator-openapi) and [SignON Orchestrator AsyncAPI](https://github.com/signon-project/wp2-orchestrator-asyncapi).  
These shared fields were created to avoid error prone redundancies in the documentation and code generation.
